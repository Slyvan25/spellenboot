"SpellenbootJS" is a Basic game site aiming for young children.

i made this site because of ad revanue but i just dont have the propper licence to publish the games.
i will work on this when i feel like it.

todo:
  - User System
    - SQL connection (maybe mongodb)
    - User page
    - api for user stats in each game
   - Admin panel for uploading more games
    - Admin form
    - Crud actions with a overview of each uploaded game
   - Entire API
    - game stats
    - Game Actions
    - IsPlaying
   maybe:
    - Chat System
